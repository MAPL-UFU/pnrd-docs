title:  Key Concepts of the Petri Network
---


Petri Nets are a graphical and mathematical modelin tool applicable to many systems.they can be used to analyse syystems characterized as being concurrent, asynchoronous, distributed, parallel, nondeterministic, and/or stochastic.

Such versatility makes the Petri nets applicable on the description and visualization of complex workflows systems as YAWL. A different regarding the RFID systems and Petri net was proposed by database. Therefore, they defined dfined a formal data structure based on the Petri nets model that contains information about the current state of the item as well as the pocess it belongs. Such data structure is stored in the tags and it is updated throught the process execution. This new approach is called Elementary Petri Nets inside RFID Database [PNRD](what-is-pnrd.md)
The Elementary Petri Nets can be structured in 3 basic elements:
- [Transitions](#transitions)
- [States](#states)
- [Arcs](#arcs)
