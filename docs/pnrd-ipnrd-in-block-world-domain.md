## Abstract

Too much effort is being invested in the automated planning field, but this area has been focusing more on improving the performance of search  algorithms in an abstract space than on applying automated planning in practice. 

Among several challenges, online replanning is an open issue. This paper presents PNRD/iPNRD integration in Blocks World Domain in order to create an adaptive control of a robotic arm and passive agents. The procedure is composed of building a Petri space,
PNRD, and iPNRD model for each agent, and by integrating their information so that the robotic arm may autonomously order the blocks to the desired final global state, stored previously in each blockâ€™s RFID tag; comparing logical and physical information, generating a sequence of movements, and executing related actions. Some issues arise because of the dispersed information, physical-logical interface and its constraints, requiring the detection of non-conformant results, optimally solve and realize the required sorting given its partial observability, and sequential movement of one block each time. The feedback from PNRD/iPNRD models with physical positioning can certify the required initial, inter- mediate and final condition and also check for exceptions, resulting in an adaptive robotic control. This didact example points out where this approach can work with automated planning for a more complex system.
